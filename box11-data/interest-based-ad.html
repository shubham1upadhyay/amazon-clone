        <h1>Interest-Based Ads</h1>
        <p>Interest-based ads are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads. We show </p>
            <p>interest-based ads to display features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. </p>
            <p>In providing interest-based ads, we follow applicable laws, as well as the Code for Self-</p>
         <p>Regulation in Advertising by the Advertising Standards Council of India and the Self-</p>
         <p>Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising </p>
          <p>Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations).</p>

          <h1>What sort of information do we use to show interest-based ads?</h1>
          <p>To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with Amazon </p>
           <p>sites, content, or services. We do not use information which on its own identifies you, such as </p>
           <p>name or e-mail address, to serve interest-based ads.</p>

           <p>As is common in the advertising industry, we use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively,</p> 
           <p>"cookies"), which enable us to understand the effectiveness of the interest-based ads we show you </p>
           <p>by measuring what ads are clicked or viewed, and to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. </p>
           <p>For example, if we know what ads are shown to your browser we can be careful not to show the same </p>
           <p>ads repeatedly.
            
           <p>See our Privacy Notice for more information about the types of information that we gather.</p>
